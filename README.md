# [Botpress](https://botpress.io) ‚Äî The open-source bot platform

[![CodeBuild](https://codebuild.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/badges?uuid=eyJlbmNyeXB0ZWREYXRhIjoiNTZoU0wzRmRQd29iWTFqVjliUzlvN0gzUUtoN25QVHlHMUhWYkZCWHpPQ3ZKQzFOMFh6Wm5EcHkxQW5SUmJuTFpLSDJXdURDVzNtRjM5d1BaU2pNUHhJPSIsIml2UGFyYW1ldGVyU3BlYyI6Iitoa0RBM091SnlXNTJwK2MiLCJtYXRlcmlhbFNldFNlcmlhbCI6MX0%3D&branch=master)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects/botpress-ce-tests/history?region=us-east-1)

Botpress is an open-source bot creation tool written in TypeScript. It is powered by a rich set of open-source modules built by the community. We like to say that **Botpress is like the WordPress of bots**; anyone can create and reuse other people's modules.

### About V11

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Status

Botpress Server (v11) is currently in beta and is **not considered ready for production use** yet. If you are looking for the latest stable version, please [checkout Botpress v10.x](https://github.com/botpress/botpress/tree/archive/10.x).

#### What has changed

There are 3 major differences between Botpress X (10.x) and Botpress Server (11.x).

1. v11 is not an NPM library anymore ‚Äì it is a standalone application. We distribute binaries of v11 for OSX, Windows, Linux and Docker on a daily basis.

2. v11 now supports multiple bots natively ‚Äì thus the naming of Botpress Server.

3. v11 is a complete backend rewrite to TypeScript. We have made significant architectural changes that are not backward-compatible. _TODO: List of all changes_

## What's New in Botpress Server

Botpress is on a mission to make useful bots ubiquitous by providing developers with cutting-edge tools to build & manage chatbots. We believe that in order to create great bots, significant time should be spent on user experience, **not** on the surrounding (and generic) features.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Node 10.11 (you can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)) and Yarn.

1. Run `yarn` to fetch node packages.
1. Run `yarn build` to build the core, the UI and the modules.
1. Run `yarn start` to start the server.

### Building issues

If you encounter errors when building modules (timeout, random errors, etc), try the following:

1. Go in each module folder and type `yarn && yarn build`

## Build the Botpress Pro Edition

To build the Pro Edition, set the environment variable `EDITION` or create an empty file named `pro` in the root folder.
This will fetch the pro submodule and build the app. By default, `yarn build` will target the Community Edition.

## Documentation

### Developer's Guide

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/en/) to create the Developer's Guide.

- To start the development server, run `yarn start:guide`
- To generate the static files, run `yarn build:guide`. The generated files will appear under `/docs/guide/build`
- To deploy a new version of the documentation, run `yarn run version <version here>`

### SDK Reference

We use [TypeDoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc) to generate the SDK Reference directly from the source code.

- Run `yarn build:reference` to generate the documentation. THe static files will appear under `/docs/reference/public`.
